  "question": "what is the inductive learning hypothesis",
  "response": "Based on the context provided, the inductive learning hypothesis is defined as:\n\n\"Any hypothesis found to approximate the target function well over a sufficiently large set of training examples will also approximate the target function well over other unobserved examples.\"\n\nThis is explicitly stated in section 2.2.2 of the document. The text explains that this is the fundamental assumption of inductive learning, noting that \"lacking any further information, our assumption is that the best hypothesis regarding unseen instances is the hypothesis that best fits the observed training data.\" The document further notes that this is a key assumption that inductive learning algorithms rely on, and that the book will revisit and analyze this assumption more formally in later chapters (5, 6, and 7). This hypothesis is the core principle that allows inductive learning to function, as it assumes that patterns found in training data will generalize to new, unseen data.",
