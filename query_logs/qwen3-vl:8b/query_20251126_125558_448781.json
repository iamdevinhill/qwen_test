  "question": "what is the inductive learning hypothesis",
  "response": "Based on the context provided, the inductive learning hypothesis is defined as: \"Any hypothesis found to approximate the target function well over a sufficiently large set of training examples will also approximate the target function well over other unobserved examples.\"\n\nThis is stated in the section titled \"2.2.2 The Inductive Learning Hypothesis,\" where it explains that although learning algorithms aim to find a hypothesis identical to the target concept over the entire instance space, they can only guarantee that the output hypothesis fits the target concept over the training data. The inductive learning hypothesis is the fundamental assumption that the best hypothesis for unseen instances is the one that best fits the observed training data. The text notes that this is \"the fundamental assumption of inductive learning\" and that it will be analyzed more formally in later chapters.",
